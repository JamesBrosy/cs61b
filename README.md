# About

This repo is my solutions of cs61b-sp18 and cs61b-sp23.

> **Declaration**
> 
> cs61b-sp18 and cs61b-sp23 have been over by now, so my solutions won't influence normal education.
> I'm not an undergraduate from Berkeley witch means that I have no need to obey cs61b policies about
> forbidding posting code from the course publicly. My aim is to save my learning outcomes and provide
> some help for other undergraduates not from Berkeley who are learning cs61b.
