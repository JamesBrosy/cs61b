All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I used the skills that professor Josh said in classes, such as Using private helper methods, fixing
   my problems by debugger etc.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: 1. I have learnt how to resize and shrink an array which is seemed that the size can not be changed.
   2. I have learnt the beginning and the end of the Array we build can not be default, and
   They are just relative.
   3. I have learnt the advantages of classes, like encapsulation etc.


Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: When trying to finish the methods addFirst and removeFirst, I do not know how to start
   at the beginning, because In my mind, the beginning of the ArrayDeque should be the first
   item of the array. So that's what I wish to know before writing ArrayDeque

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I want to do some optimization of the access control and code styles.
